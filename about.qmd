Hi there, I'm Prajwal Suresh. I'm currently exploring Deep learning, machine learning and data engineering technologies. This is where I write about my learning journey and explorations

<!-- I'm an experienced Data Scientist with specialized skills in machine learning-based solutions. I enjoy staying on top of cutting-edge data technologies, including big data platforms, deep learning, optimization methods, and business analytics. My current work involves building data-driven products to enable smarter recommendations for Microsoft Partners, M365 service administrators and end-users to ensure the best usage of M365 services. Before that, I have experience working in various verticals like agricultural technology, pharmaceuticals, retail, e-commerce, and ride-sharing business model. -->
